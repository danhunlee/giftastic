// In this homework, the main job was to call AJAX to receive data from the giphy.com 
// My topic is about NFL players and I had to retrieve gifs and display it on the browser. 
// In the index.html, there is no informaiton about the specific players. All in the code.js using an array and having the #add.gif function, I added new NFL players to the array. Also using the .gifs-view function, I made sure that when you click the button, the gif is at first "still" then when you click the gif, it "animates."
